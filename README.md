## 👨‍⚖️ For the Jury (Verification Guide)

**Dear Dr. Sushanta Kumar, Mr. Prabhas Raj, and Dr. Sandipan Mallik,**

Thank you for reviewing our project. **techmedics-108+** is a high-performance Emergency Response System (ERS) designed to streamline communication between callers, dispatchers, and ambulance drivers.

### How to Verify the Project:
1. **Dispatcher Dashboard**: Access at `http://localhost:5000/`. You can see active calls and ambulance locations.
2. **Driver Portal**: Click the **"Driver Portal"** button on the dashboard or go to `http://localhost:5000/api/ambulance/app`.
3. **Location Tracking**: Use the **"Initiate Emergency Response"** form to simulate a call. You will receive a location sharing link (simulated for the demo).
4. **Real-time Sync**: Notice how maps update instantly across the Dashboard and Driver Portal when an ambulance is assigned or a location is shared.
